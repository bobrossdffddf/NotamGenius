Training Certification Tracker - Complete Implementation Specification
Project Overview
Implement a comprehensive training certification system for a Discord bot that manages military aviation operations. This system should integrate with the existing bot architecture (Discord.js v14, file-based data storage) and provide full training lifecycle management.
Database Architecture
Recommended Database Solution
Since the bot currently uses file-based storage, implement SQLite database for persistence:
// Use better-sqlite3 package for synchronous operations
const Database = require('better-sqlite3');
const db = new Database('training_data.db');
// Create tables on startup
db.exec(`
 CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS certifications (
   id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
   user_id TEXT,
   cert_type TEXT,
   cert_level TEXT,
   date_earned TEXT,
   instructor_id TEXT,
   notes TEXT
 );
  CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS training_sessions (
   id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
   trainee_id TEXT,
   instructor_id TEXT,
   session_type TEXT,
   date TEXT,
   hours REAL,
   notes TEXT,
   progress_score INTEGER
 );
  CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS written_exams (
   id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
   user_id TEXT,
   cert_type TEXT,
   score INTEGER,
   date_taken TEXT,
   passed INTEGER
 );
`);
